# Bike Sharing Data Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes the Capital Bikeshare dataset to compute key statistics and build predictive models. It includes modules for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training. The repository is structured for production deployment with unit tests and clear modular code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bike_sharing_project.git
   cd bike_sharing_project
   ```
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Analysis
To compute the average of the `cnt` column:
```bash
python src/analysis.py
```
The script will read the CSV file from the `data/` folder and output the average value of the `cnt` column.

### Running Tests
Unit tests are available in the `tests/` folder. To run the tests:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Production Deployment
This project is structured for ease of deployment:
- **Modular Code:** Functions are separated into different modules.
- **Testing:** Unit tests ensure code quality.
- **Configuration:** Paths and parameters can be easily configured via environment variables or config files.
- **Packaging:** Use `setup.py` for packaging if deploying as a Python package.

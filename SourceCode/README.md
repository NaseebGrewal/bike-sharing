# Bike Sharing Data Analysis and Prediction


## Bike Sharing Project

### 3. README File (README.md)

## Overview
This project analyzes bike-sharing data (from the Capital Bikeshare dataset) to compute key statistics and build predictive models. It demonstrates how to preprocess data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and, optionally, train models. The code is organized into clear, modular components and includes unit tests to ensure reliability.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the raw CSV files.
- **src/**: Holds all source code including data processing and model code.
- **tests/**: Contains unit tests to ensure code reliability.
- **requirements.txt**: List all required packages (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).
- **setup.py**: (Optional) For packaging the project as a Python package.
- **.gitignore**: To exclude files (like virtual environment folders, logs, etc.) from version control.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bike_sharing_project.git
   cd bike_sharing_project
   ```
2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate    # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Project

### Analysis Script
The main script loads data from the data/hour.csv, perform eda, preprocess the data, and trains the model
```bash
python src/main.py
```
The script will load data from the `data/` folder, perform the analysis, and output results to the console.

### Running Unit Tests
To ensure that all functions are working correctly, run the unit tests:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Development Workflow
- **Modular Design:** Functions are separated into modules (`analysis.py` for data analysis and `models.py` for model-related code).
- **Testing:** Unit tests located in the `tests/` folder help verify our code changes.
- **Configuration:** Easily adjust parameters and file paths if needed.
